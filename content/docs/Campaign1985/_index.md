In 1985 the Streatham Common Environmental Cooperative was founded.  The documents were passed to Humphrey Drummond by Mark Guthrie.  

Mark lived in Number 11 Streatham Common South who was one of the original members along with Bernard Jupp who lived in 10 Streatham Common South for many years.

Conservation area status [was achieved by 1994](https://www.lambeth.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/conservation-and-listed-buildings/conservation-area-profiles/streatham-common-ca43)

The original document submitted in conjunction with the Streatham Society is available here, [proposals for designation as a Conservation area](/1985/2012_04_30_16_50_03.pdf).
