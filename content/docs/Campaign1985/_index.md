In 1985 the Streatham Common Environmental Cooperative was founded.  This information was passed to Humphrey Drummond by Mark Guthrie who lived in Number 11 Streatham Common South who was one of the original members along with Bernard Jupp who lived in Number 10 Streatham Common South for many years.

[This was achieved by 1994](https://www.lambeth.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/conservation-and-listed-buildings/conservation-area-profiles/streatham-common-ca43)

The original document submitted in conjunction with the Streatham Society is listed [Proposals for designation a Conservation area](/1985/2012_04_30_16_50_03.pdf)
