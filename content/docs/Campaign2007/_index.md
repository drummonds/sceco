![MC Streatham.jpg](http://www.sceco.org.uk/Portals/0/2006-11A/MC%20Streatham.jpg  "Proposed development (only part)")

I first wrote this article in 2006 and yet again the conservation area is under threat.  Residents of conservation areas should be able to have confidence that developers won't be able to spoil their local
environment. After all, what is the benefit of designating
"conservation areas" if the areas are not preserved and given some protection? 
People living around Streatham Common have grave concerns that a proposed development of 7 two story houses on the site of 11A Streatham Common South makes a mockery of the Conservation area status
of their local area.

Conservation area status requires a high standard of design which is not evident in the proposal. The scheme does not acknowledge the quality of the period
houses close by and the scale and density of the development is not in keeping with the local area.

The development will have an ecological impact. It will require the felling of a number of mature trees - some of which are prime specimens. This development would also have an impact on local wildlife as the area provides a habitat for many bird species including parrots and woodpeckers, and a visiting heron plus newts, frogs and foxes.

Streatham

Common is a major feature of the local landscape and has a series of fine Georgian and Victorian houses, 
some built by famous architects and others listed, around its perimeter. It attracts visitors from all over
the borough and beyond who come for the open space it affords. The
proposed ![Garden.gif](http://www.sceco.org.uk/Portals/0/Garden.gif)development
would have an impact on these visitors' enjoyment as it will cause a
physical break in the appearance of the road when viewed from the common
and destroy its integrity, profile and consistency.

Number 11A is a distinguished postmodernism post
war building of note which is locally listed and will be totally
destroyed.  It may be too late for the Yangtze dolphin but it is not too
 late for us all to save our local environment.

Local residents feel that this proposed development has no regard for the
conservation of the historic and cultural features of the area. The
proposals would start a rot, ultimately aesthetically devaluing the
whole area whose historic reputation would be compromised.

Streatham Common is currently under threat, but if it goes ahead, more areas in
Lambeth which locals had previously thought safe, could be affected and
changed for the worse. To help put a stop to this vandalism on the part
of developers, object to the plans by writing to Lambeth Planning, see [our campaign page](http://www.sceco.org.uk/Campaigns/tabid/59/Default.html).
