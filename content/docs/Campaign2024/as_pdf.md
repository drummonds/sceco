SCECO is a local cooperative which has been involved in the set up of the conservation area 39 years ago and
has been fighting tirelessly since then to preserve and enhance Streatham Common.

We ask Lambeth Planning to reject this application and give residents views and consideration of the application
itself.

# The planning application

The planning application 23/03943/FUL is explicitly for:

a. Change of use from existing builder's yard (Sui Generis) to open storage (Use Class B8)
b. provision of on-site parking
c. provision of cycle parking
d. provision of a bin store.

Implicitly in the supporting documentation it is for:
a. Expanded hours of operation
b. Expanded noise
c. Expanded vehicle movements

## Change of use existing builder's yard (Sui Generis) to open storage (Use Class B8)

### Class B8

Class B8 is defined in [The Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1987/764/contents/made) **Use for storage or as a distribution centre.**

It is not been subsequently modified up to [Use Classes Order of 2020](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/757/made).

The [Planing Geek](https://www.planninggeek.co.uk/use-class/use-class-b/) also has some more colour on what is possible an the case law for class B8 is:

```
The judgment in Newbury DC v SoS for the Environment (1981) A.C.578, states that “…storage does not have to be part of the businesses, and that as long as storage was the principal use it could be a USe Class B8 use”. Appeals have been won where classic cars were stored in a unit away from a domestic dwelling.  It is still Use Class B8, despite it looking like a garage.

Use Class B8 could also be a warehouse used for distribution. Screwfix with a trade counter would fall under B8.

If an office or shop is attached to the warehouse or distribution centre then that shop or office would also be use Class B8 as it will be ancillary to the main use.
```

#### Permitted Change of use

[Savills has a nice document](https://www.savills.co.uk/resources-and-tools/guide-to-use-classes-order-in-england/guide-to-use-classes-order-england-from-1-sep-2020.pdf) showing what further changes are then allowed:

- Permitted change to former Class B1
- Permitted change to Class C3 subject to total floorspace being no greater than 500sqm of
  floorspace in the building\*
- Temporary permitted change (2 years) to a state funded school

### Use as open storage

[Carter Jonas](https://www.carterjonas.co.uk/commercial/open-storage/classifying-sites) has a description of what open storage is for:

```Traditionally, open storage has been seen as low-quality space dedicated to scrap metal recycling, waste disposal or low-end HGV parking, however needs and growth of demand have transformed these often overlooked industrial lands into high quality storage spaces that can host high-end services and facilities.
...
...
Modern urban distribution warehouses are designed to maximise the size of the building relative to the site and in many cases site coverage is now reaching 65% or more. This leaves minimal external space for HGV movement and parking; the large fleet of vans often required to carry out last mile home deliveries; or other service uses such as staff parking and general storage. Parcel operators, for example, would normally want to operate with a site cover of 25%-35%. As a result, there has been a huge increase in requirements for urban open storage facilities to cater for these ‘overspill’ parking and storage needs.
```

#### SCECO Opinion concerns on change of use

This seems wholly inappropriate for a long established conservation area.

### Relevant development plans and frameworks:

The development plan:

- [Lambeth Local Plan (2021)](https://www.lambeth.gov.uk/planning-building-control/planning-policy-guidance/lambeth-local-plan-2021) as PDF: {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://www.lambeth.gov.uk/sites/default/files/2021-09/Lambeth%20Local%20Plan%202021.pdf"><img alt="Lambeth local plan as pdf" width="32px" src="/icons/pdf.svg" /></a> {{< /rawhtml >}}
- The London Plan (2021).

The Development Plan is supported by a range of SPDs:

- The Lambeth Design Guide SPD (Part 1 – Introducing Lambeth) (August 2023)
- The Lambeth Design Guide SPD (Part 2 – Advice for All Developments (August 2023).

Material Considerations:

- [National Planning Policy Framework](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-planning-policy-framework) (September 2023)
- [Planning Practice Guidance (PPG)](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/planning-practice-guidance).

# Historic Environment

The [Planning Practice Guidance has guidance on conserving the historic environment](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/conserving-and-enhancing-the-historic-environment)

Number 9 Streatham Common is Grade 2 listed and the curtilage is a boundary will with number 6 Streatham Common South.

Other buildings in the neighbourhood are the [locally listed](https://www.lambeth.gov.uk/sites/default/files/2022-01/local_heritage_list_19.01.22.pdf)

- Ripley House 10 Streatham Common South
- 11 Streatham Common South
- 13 Streatham Common South
- 14 Streatham Common South

# Reasons for rejection of this planning application

- The applicant has failed to provide a Tree Survey as is required
- The applicant has filed to provide a Sustainable Urban Drainage System to deal with local flooding as per second C 2.92
- The applicant has failed to enhance the quality of open space D 5
- The loss of the existing builder’s yard use would compromise the council’s employment objectives. As such, the proposal is contrary to London Plan (2021) policies E2C and E7A and Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) policy ED4.

## Reasons that the application is in error and should be withdrawn

- The planning application refers to a single owner whereas the title deeds refer to two owners.
-

{{< rawhtml >}}<hr/>{{< /rawhtml >}}

- Contravention of the London Borough of Lambeth's obligations for the preservation and enhancement of a Conservation area under Sections 72 (1) and (2) of the Planning (listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990
- The proposal is with the curtilage of a listed building, No 9 Streatham Common South
- Essentially 24 x 7 operation from limited hours when operated as a builders yard.
- Noise and pollution
- Traffic Congestion and Pollution
- an uplift of Transport movements
- Inadequate and/or safe access/egress to the premises
- Pedestrian and Common Users Health and Safety
- The extension of working hours on the premises as from the previous use by Lewis & Co Builders Merchants whose permitted hours of work were 8am to 5pm Monday to Friday and 8am to noon on Saturday only
- An inadequate transport assessment of B8 sue with specific referenc to an Inner London site
- No Trade is noted for the site although HGV's are shown on the Transport Appraisal Swept Path Analysis

## Issues

1. The planning application is wrong and I think a tree survey is required.

- There is at least one tree on the site so the answer to Trees and Hedges is wrong.
- There are large trees adjacent to the site that might have to be pruned so I believe the second part is wrong
- A number of pine trees have been cut down and removed from and adjacent garden presumably in preparation for this work and this will have affected the view from Streatham Common.

1. The site does regularly flood during heavy rain.
1. The increased traffic and congestion is going to lead to loss and so change of use of adjacent Streatham Common South.
1. The [Land registry title register](/2023-6scs/6scs/2023-08-04_summary_of_title_SGL377507_GOV.UKa.pdf) denote two owners of the land but this application only shows one owner Nw1 IOS 1 Unit Trust.

Block plan

1. Does not include existing bunds nor demolition of existing bunds
1. Does not include sand bagging block nor demolition of the bagging block

## Heritage assessment

- Inaccurate in that the yard has been in operation as a builders yard for over 200 years not 70 years.
- Inaccurate in that there are no trees when there is clearly one tree which No 9 has communicted about at Council hearingson previous objects and to previous owners and consultants.
- Streatham high road to the west is not adjacent to the site. No 6 is in fact next to a nursing home and residential uses.
- The site covers 2,3,4 not only 4 as is claimed. ![pTAL image](image.png)
- Claims bizarrely that change to B8 will be beneficial from chaning to B8 which was refused planning permission
  last time.
- Claims noise assessment shows lower sound use than current but the builders stopped a while ago so old data must be modelled.

## Old planning applications

[Number 6 Old planning applications](static/2023-6scs/6scs/6scs_planning_1950-1997.pdf)

Old applications do constrain the nuisance. It is misleading to say that there were no noise orders on previous operations as the first [noise abatement][] act was in 1960. This defines that a statutory nuisance can be due to noise or vibration. They were however not at all comprehensive or fully enforceable.

## Noise impact

[noise abatement]: https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1960/68/contents/enacted

Lewis by custom and by agreement with the council operated deliveries from 8am to 5pm Mon to Fri and from 8am to 12:00 on Saturday. The yard opened at 7am. This is recognised in the 1950's planning application as **"No nuisance or annoyance being caused which may injuriously affect the ameneties of the surround properties"**

So although 1.1.2 states that "it is understood the extant planning permission places not restictions on its use, in terms operation hours or noise emissions" That is clearly not true.

No real data was available so a modelling exercise was undertaken.

1.14 instead of betterment is planning to make worse the hours from 8:00 to 17:00 Mon to Fri to 7:00 to 19:00 Monday to Saturday 09:00 to 18:00 Sundays and Bank holidays.

Fig 1.1 is of course inaccurately drawn and includes part of number 9's garden

The absolute ultimate insult is then to allow deliveries loading and unloading at any time.

We need to check the calculations and assumptions which are supposed to conform to BS 4142.

In section 3.3.6 they average noise over an hour.

5.0 refers to a completely different application.

The use of a builders yard had 2 and then fork lift truck and a couple of lorries used for deliveries.
The numbers used by the consultants seem vastly bumped up for preovious use eg reversing alarm, assume more van movements by a tiny amount, don't do like for like forklift measurements

The noise managment plan contradicts the noise modelling by allowing gas or electric trucks rather than electric.

## Transport statement

The transport stattement has spelling mistakes eg page 2

The transport statement seems to use different data on the vehicle movements to the noise statement.
The noise impact has cherry picked data from a video which has not been provided and the transport statement
relies on data from a refused submission in 2021.

The [2021 submission](/2023-6scs/6scs/21_02840_FUL-TRANSPORT_ASSESSMENT-2710834.pdf) for the residential site calculated data from an industry standard TRICS database but did not take into account

## How does the new application mitigate the refusal of the last application

Reasons for Refusal for [22/03283/FUL](https://planning.lambeth.gov.uk/online-applications/files/231111308140D384BA9752401D39F627/pdf/22_03283_FUL--3017949.pdf)

1. By reason of the proposed demolition of all existing structures on site, the proposal would prevent the
   operations of the site as a completely empty site would not provide the amenities, facilities or storage necessary to
   operate a builder's yard. The loss of the existing builder's yard use would compromise the council's employment
   objectives. As such, the proposal is contrary to London Plan (2021) policies E2C and E7A and Lambeth Local Plan
   2020-2035 (2021) policy ED4.

_Still a valid objection due to the lost of builder's yard use. It has not been demonstrated that the planned operation would meet the council's employment objectives._

2. The applicant has failed to demonstrate how the proposed B8 open storage (in part or sole use) would
   operate on a completely vacant site without the basic amenities for workers. As such the proposals conflict with
   London Plan (2021) policy E2(b).

_Perhaps these grounds have been mitigated by retaining part of the build as basic amenities_

3. The applicant has failed to provide the requested Lighting Plan to demonstrate that there would be no
   harm to neighbouring amenity during winter hours and minimise light spill on key habitats to ensure no loss of
   biodiversity. As such, the proposals would fail to comply with London Plan (2021) policy G6 and Lambeth Local
   Plan 2020-2035 (2021) policies Q2 and EN1.

_Still a valid reason_

4. The proposed demolition of the existing boundary structures which provide screening and baffle sound
   would harm neighbouring amenity in respect of privacy, outlook and noise. As such the proposal fails to comply
   with Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) policy Q2.

_Perhaps these grounds have been mitigated by the preceeding approved plan to demolish some of the buildings._

5. The proposed operating hours and absence of a Noise Management Plan would result in the proposal
   failing to ensure that noise and other nuisances will be managed and mitigated in accordance with London Plan
   (2021) policy D13 and Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) policy Q2.

_These grounds are still valid and not mitigated by the ficitious Noise Management Plan_

6. The applicant has failed to provide details of servicing, to include a tracking diagram and confirmation that
   vehicles of 10m rigid would not enter the site. As such the proposal fails to ensure that safe turning areas are
   provided, and that the vehicles entering and exiting the site will not endanger foot and vehicular traffic. The
   proposals would therefore fail to comply with Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) policy T7.
   _These grounds are still valid_

7. The applicant has not agreed to provide a Travel Plan and enter into a s106 legal agreement to secure
   periodic travel plan reviews. As such the proposals would fail to ensure that impacts on the capacity of the
   transport network (including impacts on pedestrians and the cycle network), at the local, network-wide and
   strategic level, are fully assessed. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with London Plan (2021) policy T4
   and Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) policy T1.

   _A travel plan has been provided but it is inadequate._

8. The applicant has not agreed to the recommended condition requiring an Operational Management Plan
   detailing the use of the proposed on-site car parking spaces. In addition, the applicant has not agreed for the use
   to be permit free following the introduction of a future Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ) in the area. As such the
   proposal fails to demonstrate compliance with London Plan (2021) policy T6 and Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035
   (2021) policy T6 which require a reduction in car ownership and private car trips.

   _Still current?_

9. The proposals fail to provide details on the arrangements for refuse and recycling storage or cycle storage.
   The proposed empty site would not allow for structures which provide covered and secure storage for waste and
   cycle parking and therefore failed to comply with Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2025 (2021) policies Q5 and Q12.

   _Cycle and bin storage has been addressed._

10 The proposal fails to demonstrate compliance with London Plan 2021 policy SI 1 which requires the
construction works and operation of the site to be Air Quality Neutral or Air Quality Positive.

_Still relevant?_

### Large deliveries

Around 2000 an injunction was obtained to prevent Lewis and Co moving large articulated lorries in and out of the builders yard.  
This was causing danger to those using the pedestrian crossing to Streatham Common South. So the evolved custom
was to load and unload articulated trucks with forklifts with the lorries parked on what became double yellow lines
opposite the park. The deliveries would not start until about 8am but still interfered with parents taking
their children to school.
