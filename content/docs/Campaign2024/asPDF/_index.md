Sceco is a local cooperative which has been involved in the set up of the conservation area 39 years ago and 
has been fighting tirelessly since then to preserve and enhance Streatham Common.

# The planning application

The planning application 23/03943/FUL is explicitly for:

a. Change of use from existing builder's yard (Sui Generis) to open storage (Use Class B8)
b. provision of on-site parking
c. provision of cycle parking 
d. provision of a bin store.  

Implicitly in the supporting documentation it is for:
a. Expanded hours of operation
b. Expanded vehicle movements

## Change of use existing builder's yard (Sui Generis) to open storage (Use Class B8)

Class B8 is for storage or as a distribution centre.  It is defined in [The Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1987/764/contents/made) **Use for storage or as a distribution centre.**

It is not been subsequently modified up to [Use Classes Order of 2020](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/757/made).

[Savills has a nice document](https://www.savills.co.uk/resources-and-tools/guide-to-use-classes-order-in-england/guide-to-use-classes-order-england-from-1-sep-2020.pdf) showing what further changes are then allowed:

- Permitted change to former Class B1^
- Permitted change to Class C3 subject to total floorspace being no greater than 500sqm of
floorspace in the building*
- Temporary permitted change (2 years) to a state funded school

[Carter Jonas](https://www.carterjonas.co.uk/commercial/open-storage/classifying-sites) has a description of what open storage is for:

```Traditionally, open storage has been seen as low-quality space dedicated to scrap metal recycling, waste disposal or low-end HGV parking, however needs and growth of demand have transformed these often overlooked industrial lands into high quality storage spaces that can host high-end services and facilities. ```

This seems wholly inappropriate for a long established conservation area.

## Issues

1. The planning application is wrong and I think a tree survey is rquired.

- There is at least one tree on the site so the answer to Trees and Hedges is wrong.
- There are large trees adjacent to the site that might have to be pruned so I believe the second part is wrong
- A number of pine trees have been cut down and removed from and adjacent garden presumably in preparation for this work and this will have affected the view from Streatham Common.

1. The site does regularly flood during heavy rain.
1. The increased traffic and congestion is going to lead to loss and so change of use of adjacent Streatham Common South.
1. The [Land registry title register](/2023-6scs/6scs/2023-08-04_summary_of_title_SGL377507_GOV.UKa.pdf) denote two owners of the land but this application only shows one owner Nw1 IOS 1 Unit Trust.

Block plan

1. Does not include existing bunds nor demolition of existing bunds
1. Does not include sand bagging block nor demolition of the bagging block

## Heritage assesment

- Inaccurate in that the yard has been in operation as a builders yard for over 200 years not 70 years.
- Inaccurate in that there are no trees when there is clearly one tree which No 9 has communicted about at Council hearingson previous objects and to previous owners and consultants.
- Streatham high road to the west is not adjacent to the site. No 6 is in fact next to a nursing home and residential uses.
- The site covers 2,3,4 not only 4 as is claimed. ![pTAL image](image.png)
- Claims bizarrely that change to B8 will be beneficial from chaning to B8 which was refused planning permission
  last time.
- Claims noise assesement shows lower sound use than current but the builders stopped a while ago so old data must be modelled.

## Old planning applications

[Number 6 Old planning applications](static/2023-6scs/6scs/6scs_planning_1950-1997.pdf)

Old applications do constrain the nuisance. It is misleading to say that there were no noise orders on previous operations as the first [noise abatement][] act was in 1960. This defines that a statutory nuisance can be due to noise or vibration. They were however not at all comprehensive or fully enforceable.

## Noise impact

[noise abatement]: https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1960/68/contents/enacted

Lewis by custom and by agreement with the council operated deliveries from 8am to 5pm Mon to Fri and from 8am to 12:00 on Saturday. The yard opened at 7am. This is recognised in the 1950's planning application as **"No nuisance or annoyance being caused whih may injuriously affect the ameneties of the surround properties"**

So although 1.1.2 states that "it is understood the extant planning permission places not restictions on its use, in terms operation hours or noise emissions" That is clearly not true.

No real data was available so a modelling excercise was undertaken.

1.14 instead of betterment is planning to make worse the hours from 8:00 to 17:00 Mon to Fri to 7:00 to 19:00 Monday to Saturday 09:00 to 18:00 Sundays and Bank holidays.

Fig 1.1 is of course inaccurately drawn and includes part of number 9's garden

The absolute ultimate insult is then to allow deliveries loading and unloading at any time.

We need to check the calculations and assumptions which are supposed to conform to BS 4142.

In section 3.3.6 they average noise over an hour.

5.0 refers to a completely different application.

The use of a builders yard had 2 and then fork lift truck and a couple of lorries used for deliveries.
The numbers used by the consultants seem vastly bumped up for preovious use eg reversing alarm, assume more van movements by a tiny amount, don't do like for like forklift measurements

The noise managment plan contradicts the noise modelling by allowing gas or electric trucks rather than electric.

## Transport statement

The transport stattement has spelling mistakes eg page 2

The transport statement seems to use different data on the vehicle movements to the noise statement.
The noise impact has cherry picked data from a video which has not been provided and the transport statement
relies on data from a refused submission in 2021.

The [2021 submission](/2023-6scs/6scs/21_02840_FUL-TRANSPORT_ASSESSMENT-2710834.pdf) for the residential site calculated data from an industry standard TRICS database but did not take into account

## How does the new application mitigate the refusal of the last application

Reasons for Refusal for [22/03283/FUL](https://planning.lambeth.gov.uk/online-applications/files/231111308140D384BA9752401D39F627/pdf/22_03283_FUL--3017949.pdf)

1. By reason of the proposed demolition of all existing structures on site, the proposal would prevent the
   operations of the site as a completely empty site would not provide the amenities, facilities or storage necessary to
   operate a builder's yard. The loss of the existing builder's yard use would compromise the council's employment
   objectives. As such, the proposal is contrary to London Plan (2021) policies E2C and E7A and Lambeth Local Plan
   2020-2035 (2021) policy ED4.

_Still a valid objection due to the lost of builder's yard use. It has not been demonstrated that the planned operation would meet the council's employement objectives._

2. The applicant has failed to demonstrate how the proposed B8 open storage (in part or sole use) would
   operate on a completely vacant site without the basic amenities for workers. As such the proposals conflict with
   London Plan (2021) policy E2(b).

_Perhaps these grounds have been mitigated by retaining part of the build as basic amenities_

3. The applicant has failed to provide the requested Lighting Plan to demonstrate that there would be no
   harm to neighbouring amenity during winter hours and minimise light spill on key habitats to ensure no loss of
   biodiversity. As such, the proposals would fail to comply with London Plan (2021) policy G6 and Lambeth Local
   Plan 2020-2035 (2021) policies Q2 and EN1.

_Still a valid reason_

4. The proposed demolition of the existing boundary structures which provide screening and baffle sound
   would harm neighbouring amenity in respect of privacy, outlook and noise. As such the proposal fails to comply
   with Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) policy Q2.

_Perhaps these grounds have been mitigated by the succeeding approved plan to demolish some of the buildings._

5. The proposed operating hours and absence of a Noise Management Plan would result in the proposal
   failing to ensure that noise and other nuisances will be managed and mitigated in accordance with London Plan
   (2021) policy D13 and Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) policy Q2.

_These grounds are still valid and not mitigated by the ficitious Noise Management Plan_

6. The applicant has failed to provide details of servicing, to include a tracking diagram and confirmation that
   vehicles of 10m rigid would not enter the site. As such the proposal fails to ensure that safe turning areas are
   provided, and that the vehicles entering and exiting the site will not endanger foot and vehicular traffic. The
   proposals would therefore fail to comply with Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) policy T7.
   _These grounds are still valid_

7. The applicant has not agreed to provide a Travel Plan and enter into a s106 legal agreement to secure
   periodic travel plan reviews. As such the proposals would fail to ensure that impacts on the capacity of the
   transport network (including impacts on pedestrians and the cycle network), at the local, network-wide and
   strategic level, are fully assessed. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with London Plan (2021) policy T4
   and Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) policy T1.

8. The applicant has not agreed to the recommended condition requiring an Operational Management Plan
   detailing the use of the proposed on-site car parking spaces. In addition, the applicant has not agreed for the use
   to be permit free following the introduction of a future Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ) in the area. As such the
   proposal fails to demonstrate compliance with London Plan (2021) policy T6 and Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035
   (2021) policy T6 which require a reduction in car ownership and private car trips.

9. The proposals fail to provide details on the arrangements for refuse and recycling storage or cycle storage.
   The proposed empty site would not allow for structures which provide covered and secure storage for waste and
   cycle parking and therefore failed to comply with Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2025 (2021) policies Q5 and Q12.
   10 The proposal fails to demonstrate compliance with London Plan 2021 policy SI 1 which requires the
   construction works and operation of the site to be Air Quality Neutral or Air Quality Positive.

### Large deliveries

Around 2000 an injunction was obtained to prevent Lewis and Co moving large articulated lorries in and out of the builders yard.  
This was causing danger to those using the pedestrian crossing to Streatham Common South.  So the evolved custom
was to load and unload articulated trucks with forklifts with the lorries parked on what became double yellow lines
opposite the park.  The deliveries would not start until about 8am but still interfered with parents taking
their children to school.
