We are looking to develop more detailed histories of the local houses to preserve their stories.

## Silk in Streatham

In the unlikely area of the Cafe at Sainsbury's you will find some pictures and maps of the building which is now used as the Cafe.  Here a silk weaving mill was set up at the begining of the 19th century.  One of the Mulberry trees that was used for it is still growing in the garden of Number 10 Streatham Common South.  The story is that this was the wrong sort of mulberry tree for the silk worms to eat and as this was part of a plantation of mulberrry trees to feed the factory.  After this the factory failed and was turned into a rubber factory. More information on the history.

## Use of copper for mid 20th century houses

11A Streatham Common South has a beautiful verdigris copper roof which is highly unusual in a private house and complements the large open space behind.

## Old houses

Many of the houses date from the begining of the century but some date back earlier when this was the first inn on the road to Brighton.   Stages would change their horses and the open space behind numbers 7 - 14 Streatham Common South was where the stables for the horses were.  Ripley House, Number 10 Streatham Common South was the site of the old inn. 

## Streatham Common South

Originally a carriage way to Streatham Wells and Spa, the lower part was developed from mid-18th Century onwards.  Some good examples of late 18th Century townscape buildings still exist.  No 10 Ripley House is considered to be one of the oldest houses in Streatham, being built in 1774.  No 9, with its classical frontage, was built in 1778 (1789?) and has been listed by English Heritage. 

 
Lewis's builders yard was originally Mason's Yard, owned by William Mason, a local builder operating from the 1860s to the 1890s, which in 1881 employed 104 men.  Previously the yard was run by John Loat of Balham in 1850, by James Chart c1820 to 1840 and by William Wright during the 1800s. 

 

Redevelopment of South Side occurred during 1904-06 with most of the 18th Century buildings being demolished.  The upper part was developed during the 1920/30s as part of the Wellfield Estate.
